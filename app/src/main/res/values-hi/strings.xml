    <string name="cont5">प्रिय बच्चों,
आज हम एक घोड़े और गधे की कहानी सुनेंगे।

घोड़ा और गधा
एक बार की बात है एक गाँव में एक धोबी रहता था। उसके पास एक घोड़ा और एक गधा था। वह गधे का इस्तेमाल कपड़ों का बोझ गांव से नदी और वापस ले जाने के लिए करता था, जबकि वह घोड़े का इस्तेमाल अपने घूमने के लिए करता था।
एक दिन धोबी ने अपने गधे को कपड़ों के भारी बंडलों से लाद दिया, जबकि घोड़े के पास कुछ भी नहीं था। गधे के ढोने के लिए भार बहुत अधिक था। जब वे नदी के बीच में थे, तो गधा बहुत थक गया। इसलिए, उसने घोड़े से मदद माँगी । उसने घोड़े से अनुरोध किया “मित्र, यह भार बहुत अधिक है । आप कृपया मेरी मदद करेंगे? क्या आप मेरा कुछ भार साझा कर सकते हैं?"।
"मैं क्यों? घोड़े घुड़सवारी के लिए होते हैं और गदहे भारी बोझ ढोने के लिए होते हैं” घोड़े ने उत्तर दिया। बेचारा गधा भारी बोझ के साथ चलता रहा। लेकिन, कुछ देर बाद गधा इतना थक गया कि वह जमीन पर गिर पड़ा। तब धोबी को अपनी गलती का अहसास हुआ। उसने गधे को पानी दिया और सारा भार घोड़े की पीठ पर डाल दिया।

कुछ आराम करने के बाद वे फिर से नदी की ओर चलने लगे। जैसे ही वे चलने लगे घोड़े को अपनी गलती का एहसास हुआ और उसने मन ही मन सोचा “यह बहुत भारी है। मुझे गधे की मदद करनी चाहिए थी जब उसने मुझसे अनुरोध किया और आधा भार साझा किया। अब मुझे सारा भार नदी तक ले जाना होगा। अब से, मैं हमेशा भार साझा करूंगा”।
घोड़ा और गधा सबसे अच्छे दोस्त बन गए और अपना काम साझा करने लगे।
